# the-plan-is-simple

The assignment for this week is to build a day scheduler/planner where it's editable to fill out during hour slots of the day and would save whatever you wrote in there even if you left the page as long as you saved.

There is a clock with the  time at the top of the page that updates up to the very second which makes sure that you know what the exact time is. This 12 hour calendar is designed to be colored differently for hours that have passed, the current hour, and hours later in the day. You can click in any of these rows and enter any information which you can then hit save on the right hand side to have the info save to local storage. The only way for the information to be cleared is by pressing the "Clear Day!" button on the top of the html below the timer.
